## üöÄ MVP

1. **User Authentication & Authorization**  
   Secure session-based login and registration ensure that only authenticated users can create, edit, or delete recipes.

2. **Recipe Management**  
   - **Create:** Users can add recipes with fields for title, ingredients, detailed instructions, and cultural region information.
   - **Read:** A dynamic recipe index displays all recipes, with detailed views for each.
   - **Update:** Pre-filled forms allow users to edit their own recipes.
   - **Delete:** Users can remove their recipes to maintain a curated collection.

3. **Regional Focus**  
   - Each user is linked to a specific region, and every recipe is associated with a region, emphasizing cultural origins.

4. **User Interface**  
   Designed with CSS Flexbox and Grid, the UI includes accessible navigation with a persistent header and a responsive layout.
